  <h2><b>Ralph Breaks the Internet</b> My Favourite Movie</h2>
  <p>I love animated movies and Wreck it Ralph portrays the internet as an actual physical place which made the movie
    much more interesting. The level of absolute detail is wondrous, but this is decidedly not an (overly) idealized
    take on the Internet which made me love the movie.</p>
